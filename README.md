Andromeda
=========

RTS Android game. 

Deploy a new space civilisation, mine resources and build your army. 
Upgrade your mines and knowledge -> grow faster.

Minimalisation rule applied. 

Developed for the purpose of learning. 
Game isn't finished because I learned 
what I have planed, but it should be fully functional.
